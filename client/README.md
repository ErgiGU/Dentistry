# Frontend React App

## Description
The frontend is set up using React and consists of the following directories
| Directory Name | Purpose |
| ------ | ------ |
| ClinicLogin |  Log in page for the Clinics. |
| ClinicRegistration | Registration page for the clinic to create account and successfully register. |
| MyInformation | Page designed for the clinic to submit information like opening hours, lunch hours, change password, and much more. |
| Assets | Folder to store images required for the pages. |
| Clinics | Helps view map that shows all the clinics. |
| Home | Landing page for both clinics and patients. Clinics see different content after logging in than a normal patient or user. |
| Tests | Tests for a functioning frontend. |

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
