# Frontend React App

## Description
The frontend is set up using React and consists of the following directories
| Directory Name | Purpose |
| ------ | ------ |
| ClinicLogin |  Log in page for the Clinics. |
| ClinicRegistration | Registration page for the clinic to create account and successfully register. |
| MyInformation | Page designed for the clinic to submit information like opening hours, lunch hours, change password, and much more. |
| Assets | Folder to store images required for the pages. |
| Clinics | Helps view map that shows all the clinics. |
| Home | Landing page for both clinics and patients. Clinics see different content after logging in than a normal patient or user. |
| Tests | Tests for a functioning frontend. |

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
